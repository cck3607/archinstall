## Start of Install 

The first step is downloading the arch iso. It is very important that you connect this iso via the setting and cd/disk image. Should also boot in UEFI mode. Once connected the first thing you should do is check you internet connect. The first iso I downloaded did not allow me to connect to the internet after a few hours of trying to fix it I finally downloaded a different iso that connected to the internet right away. 

### Once inside the VM

After gaining access to the VM with your iso follow these steps.
